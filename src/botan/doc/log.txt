Release Notes
========================================

Series 1.10
----------------------------------------

Version 1.10.10, 2015-08-03
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* SECURITY: The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0
  of an empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not
  contain any data at all. As the type requires a 1 byte field this is
  not valid BER but could occur in malformed data. Found with afl.

* SECURITY: The BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount
  of memory in a length field, even if there was no chance the read
  request would succeed. This might cause the process to run out of
  memory or invoke the OOM killer. Found with afl.

* Due to an ABI incompatible (though not API incompatible) change in
  this release, the version number of the shared object has been
  increased.

* The default TLS policy no longer allows RC4.

* Fix a signed integer overflow in Blue Midnight Wish that may cause
  incorrect computations or undefined behavior.

Version 1.10.9, 2014-12-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed EAX tag verification to run in constant time

* The default TLS policy now disables SSLv3.

* A crash could occur when reading from a blocking random device if
  the device initially indicated that entropy was available but
  a concurrent process drained the entropy pool before the
  read was initiated.

* Fix decoding indefinite length BER constructs that contain a context
  sensitive tag of zero. Github pull 26 from Janusz Chorko.

* The `botan-config` script previously tried to guess its prefix from
  the location of the binary. However this was error prone, and now
  the script assumes the final installation prefix matches the value
  set during the build. Github issue 29.

Version 1.10.8, 2014-04-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix a bug in primality testing introduced in 1.8.3 which caused only
  a single random base, rather than a sequence of random bases, to be
  used in the Miller-Rabin test. This increased the probability that a
  non-prime would be accepted, for instance a 1024 bit number would be
  incorrectly classed as prime with probability around 2^-40. Reported
  by Jeff Marrison.

* The key length limit on HMAC has been raised to 512 bytes, allowing
  the use of very long passphrases with PBKDF2.

Version 1.10.7, 2013-12-29
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* OAEP had two bugs, one of which allowed it to be used even if the
  key was too small, and the other of which would cause a crash during
  decryption if the EME data was too large for the associated key.

Version 1.10.6, 2013-11-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The device reading entropy source now attempts to read from all
  available devices. Previously it would break out early if a partial
  read from a blocking source occured, not continuing to read from a
  non-blocking device. This would cause the library to fall back on
  slower and less reliable techniques for collecting PRNG seed
  material. Reported by Rickard Bellgrim.

* HMAC_RNG (the default PRNG implementation) now automatically reseeds
  itself periodically. Previously reseeds only occured on explicit
  application request.

* Fix an encoding error in EC_Group when encoding using EC_DOMPAR_ENC_OID.
  Reported by fxdupont on github.

* In EMSA2 and Randpool, avoid calling name() on objects after deleting them if
  the provided algorithm objects are not suitable for use.  Found by Clang
  analyzer, reported by Jeffrey Walton.

* If X509_Store was copied, the u32bit containing how long to cache validation
  results was not initialized, potentially causing results to be cached for
  significant amounts of time. This could allow a certificate to be considered
  valid after its issuing CA's cert expired. Expiration of the end-entity cert
  is always checked, and reading a CRL always causes the status to be reset, so
  this issue does not affect revocation. Found by Coverity scanner.

* Avoid off by one causing a potentially unterminated string to be passed to
  the connect system call if the library was configured to use a very long path
  name for the EGD socket. Found by Coverity Scanner.

* In PK_Encryptor_EME, PK_Decryptor_EME, PK_Verifier, and PK_Key_Agreement,
  avoid dereferencing an unitialized pointer if no engine supported operations
  on the key object given. Found by Coverity scanner.

* Avoid leaking a file descriptor in the /dev/random and EGD entropy sources if
  stdin (file descriptor 0) was closed. Found by Coverity scanner.

* Avoid a potentially undefined operation in the bit rotation operations.  Not
  known to have caused problems under any existing compiler, but might have
  caused problems in the future. Caught by Clang sanitizer, reported by Jeffrey
  Walton.

* Increase default hash iterations from 10000 to 50000 in PBES1 and PBES2

* Add a fix for mips64el builds from Brad Smith.

Version 1.10.5, 2013-03-02
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A potential crash in the AES-NI implementation of the AES-192 key
  schedule (caused by misaligned loads) has been fixed.

* A previously conditional operation in Montgomery multiplication and
  squaring is now always performed, removing a possible timing
  channel.

* Use correct flags for creating a shared library on OS X under Clang.

* Fix a compile time incompatability with Visual C++ 2012

Version 1.10.4, 2013-01-07
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Avoid a conditional operation in the power mod implementations on if
  a nibble of the exponent was zero or not. This may help protect
  against certain forms of side channel attacks.

* The SRP6 code was checking for invalid values as specified in RFC
  5054, specifically values equal to zero mod p. However SRP would
  accept negative A/B values, or ones larger than p, neither of which
  should occur in a normal run of the protocol. These values are now
  rejected. Credits to Timothy Prepscius for pointing out these values
  are not normally used and probably signal something fishy.

* The return value of version_string is now a compile time constant
  string, so version information can be more easily extracted from
  binaries.

Version 1.10.3, 2012-07-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A change in 1.10.2 accidentally broke ABI compatibility with 1.10.1
  and earlier versions, causing programs compiled against 1.10.1 to
  crash if linked with 1.10.2 at runtime.

* Recent versions of OpenSSL include extra information in ECC private
  keys, the presence of which caused an exception when such a key was
  loaded by botan. The decoding of ECC private keys has been changed
  to ignore these fields if they are set.

Version 1.10.2, 2012-06-17
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To protect clients against renegotiation attacks, the TLS client
  now sends the renegotiation extension SCSV.

* TLS renegotiation is completely disabled in this release. All hello
  requests, and all client hellos after the initial negotiation, are
  ignored.

* Fix bugs in TLS affecting DSA servers.

* Pipe::reset no longer requires that message processing be completed,
  a requirement that caused problems when a Filter's end_msg call
  threw an exception, after which point the Pipe object was no longer
  usable.

* Add support for the rdrand instruction introduced in Intel's Ivy
  Bridge processors.

* CPUID::has_rdrand was checking the wrong cpuid bit, and would false
  positive on AMD Bulldozer processors.

* Add the Camellia block cipher

* An implementation of SRP-6a compatible with the specification in
  RFC 5054 is now available in srp6.h

* The exception catching syntax of configure.py has been changed to
  the Python 3.x syntax. This syntax also works with Python 2.6 and
  2.7, but not with any earlier Python 2 release. A simple search and
  replace will allow running it under Python 2.5::
     perl -pi -e 's/except (.*) as (.*):/except $1, $2:/g' configure.py

* If clock_gettime is available on the system, poll all available
  clock types in the hres_timer poll.

* Add AltiVec detection for IBM POWER7 processors.

* Add AltiVec detection for OpenBSD, contributed by Brad Smith (PR 162)

* Add Google's Native Client as an compile target

* The Qt mutex wrapper was broken and would not compile with any recent
  version of Qt. It has been removed.

* If targetting GCC on a Windows system, configure.py will warn that
  likely you wanted to configure for either MinGW or Cygwin, not the
  generic Windows target which is oriented to Win32 plus the Visual
  C++ runtime.

* Fixed a compilation problem of the dynamic loader hooks under MinGW GCC

* Don't set a soname on OpenBSD, as it doesn't support it (PR 158)

* Fix a configure.py incompatability with the subprocess module
  included in Python 3.1 (PR 157)

* A bug in configure.py would cause it to interpret `--cpu=s390x` as
  `s390`. This may have affected other CPUs as well. Now configure.py
  searches for an exact match, and only if no exact match is found
  will it search for substring matches.

Version 1.10.1, 2011-07-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A race condition in `Algorithm_Factory` could cause crashes in
  multithreaded code. See `this thread on botan-devel
  <http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/botan-devel/2011-July/001455.html>`_
  for details and workarounds.

* The return value of ``name`` has changed for GOST 28147-89 and
  Skein-512.  GOST's ``name`` now includes the name of the sbox, and
  Skein's includes the personalization string (if nonempty). This
  allows an object to be properly roundtripped, which is necessary to
  fix the race condition described above.

* A new distribution script is now included, as
  ``src/build-data/scripts/dist.py``

* The ``build.h`` header now includes, if available, an identifier of
  the source revision that was used. This identifier is also included
  in the result of ``version_string``.

Version 1.10.0, 2011-06-20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Detection for the rdrand instruction being added to upcoming Intel
  Ivy Bridge processors has been added.

* A template specialization of std::swap was added for the memory
  container types.

Series 1.9
----------------------------------------

Version 1.9.18, 2011-06-03
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fourth release candidate for 1.10.0

* The GOST 34.10 verification operation was not ensuring that s and r
  were both greater than zero. This could potentially have meant it
  would have accepted an invalid all-zero signature as valid for any
  message. Due to how ECC points are internally represented it instead
  resulted in an exception being thrown.

* A simple multiexponentation algorithm is now used in ECDSA and
  GOST-34.10 signature verification, leading to 20 to 25% improvements
  in ECDSA and 25% to 40% improvements in GOST-34.10 verification
  performance.

* The internal representation of elliptic curve points has been
  modified to use Montgomery representation exclusively, resulting in
  reduced memory usage and a 10 to 20% performance improvement for
  ECDSA and ECDH.

* In OAEP decoding, scan for the delimiter bytes using a loop that is
  written without conditionals so as to help avoid timing analysis.
  Unfortunately GCC at least is 'smart' enough to compile it to
  jumps anyway.

* The SSE2 implementation of IDEA did not work correctly when compiled
  by Clang, because the trick it used to emulate a 16 bit unsigned
  compare in SSE (which doesn't contain one natively) relied on signed
  overflow working in the 'usual' way. A different method that doesn't
  rely on signed overflow is now used.

* Add support for compiling SSL using Visual C++ 2010's TR1
  implementation.

* Fix a bug under Visual C++ 2010 which would cause ``hex_encode`` to
  crash if given a zero-sized input to encode.

* A new build option ``--via-amalgamation`` will first generate the
  single-file amalgamation, then build the library from that single
  file. This option requires a lot of memory and does not parallelize,
  but the resulting library is smaller and may be faster.

* On Unix, the library and header paths have been changed to allow
  parallel installation of different versions of the library. Headers
  are installed into ``<prefix>/include/botan-1.9/botan``, libraries
  are named ``libbotan-1.9``, and ``botan-config`` is now namespaced
  (so in this release ``botan-config-1.9``). All of these embedded
  versions will be 1.10 in the upcoming stable release.

* The soname system has been modified. In this release the library
  soname is ``libbotan-1.9.so.0``, with the full library being named
  ``libbotan-1.9.so.0.18``. The ``0`` is the ABI version, and will be
  incremented whenever a breaking ABI change is made.

* TR1 support is not longer automatically assumed under older versions
  of GCC

* Functions for base64 decoding that work standalone (without needing
  to use a pipe) have been added to ``base64.h``

* The function ``BigInt::to_u32bit`` was inadvertently removed in 1.9.11
  and has been added back.

* The function ``BigInt::get_substring`` did not work correctly with a
  *length* argument of 32.

* The implementation of ``FD_ZERO`` on Solaris uses ``memset`` and
  assumes the caller included ``string.h`` on its behalf. Do so to
  fix compilation in the ``dev_random`` and ``unix_procs`` entropy
  sources. Patch from Jeremy C. Reed.

* Add two different configuration targets for Atom, since some are
  32-bit and some are 64-bit. The 'atom' target now refers to the
  64-bit implementations, use 'atom32' to target the 32-bit
  processors.

* The (incomplete) support for CMS and card verifiable certificates
  are disabled by default; add ``--enable-modules=cms`` or
  ``--enable-modules=cvc`` during configuration to turn them back on.

Version 1.9.17, 2011-04-29
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Third release candidate for 1.10.0

* The format preserving encryption method currently available was
  presented in the header ``fpe.h`` and the functions ``fpe_encrypt``
  and ``fpe_decrypt``. These were renamed as it is likely that other
  FPE schemes will be included in the future. The header is now
  ``fpe_fe1.h``, and the functions are named ``fe1_encrypt`` and
  ``fe1_decrypt``. See :doc:`fpe` for more information.

* New options to ``configure.py`` control what tools are used for
  documentation generation. The ``--with-sphinx`` option enables using
  Sphinx to convert ReST into HTML; otherwise the ReST sources are
  installed directly. If ``--with-doxygen`` is used, Doxygen will run
  as well. Documentation generation can be triggered via the ``docs``
  target in the makefile; it will also be installed by the install
  target on Unix.

* A bug in 1.9.16 effectively disabled support for runtime CPU feature
  detection on x86 under GCC in that release.

* A mostly internal change, all references to "ia32" and "amd64" have
  been changed to the vendor neutral and probably easier to understand
  "x86-32" and "x86-64". For instance, the "mp_amd64" module has been
  renamed "mp_x86_64", and the macro indicating x86-32 has changed
  from ``BOTAN_TARGET_ARCH_IS_IA32`` to
  ``BOTAN_TARGET_ARCH_IS_X86_32``. The classes calling assembly have
  also been renamed.

* Similiarly to the above change, the AES implemenations using the
  AES-NI instruction set have been renamed from AES_XXX_Intel to
  AES_XXX_NI.

* Systems that are identified as `sun4u` will default to compiling for
  32-bit SPARCv9 code rather than 64-bit. This matches the still
  common convention for 32-bit SPARC userspaces. If you want 64-bit
  code on such as system, use ``--cpu=sparc64``.

* Some minor fixes for compiling botan under the BeOS
  clone/continuation `Haiku <http://haiku-os.org>`_.

* Further updates to the documentation

Version 1.9.16, 2011-04-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Second release candidate for 1.10.0

* The documentation, previously written in LaTeX, is now in
  reStructuredText suitable for processing by `Sphinx
  <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_, which can generate nicely formatted
  HTML and PDFs. The documentation has also been greatly updated and
  expanded.

* The class ``EC_Domain_Params`` has been renamed ``EC_Group``, with a
  typedef for backwards compatability.

* ``EC_Group``'s string constructor didn't understand the standard
  names like "secp160r1", forcing use of the OIDs.

* Two constructors for ECDSA private keys, the one that creates a new
  random key, and the one that provides a preset private key as a
  ``BigInt``, have been merged. This matches the existing interface
  for DSA and DH keys. If you previously used the version taking a
  ``BigInt`` private key, you'll have to additionally pass in a
  ``RandomNumberGenerator`` object starting in this release.

* It is now possible to create ECDH keys with a preset ``BigInt``
  private key; previously no method for this was available.

* The overload of ``generate_passhash9`` that takes an explicit
  algorithm identifier has been merged with the one that does not.
  The algorithm identifier code has been moved from the second
  parameter to the fourth. See :ref:`passhash9` for details.

* Change shared library versioning to match the normal Unix
  conventions. Instead of ``libbotan-X.Y.Z.so``, the shared lib is
  named ``libbotan-X.Y.so.Z``; this allows the runtime linker to do
  its runtime linky magic. It can be safely presumed that any change
  in the major or minor version indicates ABI incompatability.

* Remove the socket wrapper code; it was not actually used by anything
  in the library, only in the examples, and you can use whatever kind
  of (blocking) socket interface you like with the SSL/TLS code. It's
  available as socket.h in the examples directory if you want to use
  it.

* Disable the by-default 'strong' checking of private keys that are
  loaded from storage. You can always request key material sanity
  checking using Private_Key::check_key.

* Bring back removed functions ``min_keylength_of``,
  ``max_keylength_of``, ``keylength_multiple_of`` in ``lookup.h`` to
  avoid breaking applications written against 1.8

Version 1.9.15, 2011-03-21
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* First release candidate for 1.10.0

* Modify how message expansion is done in SHA-256 and SHA-512.
  Instead of expanding the entire message at the start, compute them
  in the minimum number of registers. Values are computed 15 rounds
  before they are needed. On a Core i7-860, GCC 4.5.2, went from 143
  to 157 MiB/s in SHA-256, and 211 to 256 MiB/s in SHA-512.

* Pipe will delete empty output queues as soon as they are no longer
  needed, even if earlier messages still have data unread. However an
  (empty) entry in a deque of pointers will remain until all prior
  messages are completely emptied.

* Avoid reading the SPARC ``%tick`` register on OpenBSD as unlike
  Linux the kernel will not trap and emulate it for us, causing a
  illegal instruction crash.

* Improve detection and autoconfiguration for ARM processors.

Version 1.9.14, 2011-03-01
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add support for bcrypt, OpenBSD's password hashing scheme. It is
  described in :ref:`bcrypt`.

* Add support for NIST's AES key wrapping algorithm, as described in
  :rfc:`3394`. It is available by including ``rfc3394.h``.

* Fix an infinite loop in zlib filters introduced in 1.9.11 (PR 142)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update Keccak to the round 3 variant

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A race condition in `Algorithm_Factory` could cause crashes in
  multithreaded code. See `this thread on botan-devel
  <http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/botan-devel/2011-July/001455.html>`_
  for details and workarounds.
